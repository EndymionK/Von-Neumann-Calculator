# Von-Neumann-Calculator

**Project Description:**
This project is an interactive graphical simulation of the Von Neumann architecture, illustrating the basic operation of a computer at the hardware level. Implemented in Python using the Tkinter framework, this simulator allows users to see, step by step, how an instruction is executed on the machine, from loading into memory to processing in the control unit and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

**Technologies Used:** 
- **Programming languages:** Python <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/python/python-original.svg" alt="python" width="40" height="40"/>
